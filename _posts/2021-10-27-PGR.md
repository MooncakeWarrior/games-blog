Punishing Gray Raven is one of my favourite gacha right now and I am here to share my overall experience about this game

<!--more-->

##### At the time of writing this, Punishing Gray Raven is celebrating its 100th day anniversary and as a player since day-1, I want to write about my own experience with the game and how it became one of my favorite gacha games. From this point on Punishing Gray Raven will be simplified to PGR.

## The Good
I like PGR for a lot of reasons, and most of the time these reason are what keeps me interested in this game till this day.

### Skills Orb
PGR features a unique skills system that separates them from all the other competing 3D action gacha games and that is the Skills Orb, there are three types of orb: Red Orb, Yellow Orb and Blue Orb each orb correspond to the different skills to each character. At first glance, it seems confusing but after following the simple tutorial given, I was able to get the hang of it in no time. But don’t let this simple tutorial fool you, the Skills Orb is indeed easy to learn, but it is also hard to master. In order to stay on top of the game, there are a lot of factors and the most important of them all is the timing. Your timing decides everything in this game. You need to decide when to use three-pings, what to ping and most importantly when to ping them. With good timings, you could easily double your score in some stages and easily climb to the top, not to mention the feeling of satisfaction when you chained the skills correctly and just see the enemy’s health bar disappear. Overall, the orb system really adds some spice into the game and makes it so that you actually need to concentrate when playing the game to plan every move correctly in order to push the limits of the character.

### Overall Game Design
One thing I like about PGR is their immersion, they’ve done it perfectly. PGR do not have any vibrant colors or fancy effects, most of them are actually plain and simple. Now, this doesn't mean that it is bad in any way, it is the opposite, the plain and simple approach actually makes them fit into the world building of the game perfectly. The emotionless constructs, simple and plain colors, the seriousness in every line just makes me immersed in the game. It tells me that the story is not a fairytale where everything has a happy ending but instead it is about the reality, the reality where humans are struggling to survive and everything can go wrong in a flash. 

### Free to play Friendly
Before it’s global release, PGR was actually praised as a free to play friendly game. Of course no gacha is really free to play, they are all designed to earn money in a way. But PGR is a little bit different from the rest of them, they have a specific pattern to help free to play players stay in the game. For example, the update ‘Frozen Darkness’ features a gacha only characters but in the next update ‘Fallen Star’ features free farmable characters for players. This kind of rotation allows free to play players to save up quite a lot of Black Cards which is the type of paid currency used in the game in between the gacha limited characters. They also feature a banner for those limited characters which has a pity of 60 draw to help us get the character more easily. In my experience, the time between which gacha limited character is released is enough for me to get the character without much of a problem. Not only that it is possible for us to collect all limited characters, the characters equipment is also farmable making it so that everyone could have a strong character to play. Of course in order for them to let the game stay afloat, PGR also has costumes and character specific weapons which cater to their playstyle for people who support the game to give them an edge over certain situations. Overall, it is possible to play this game without paying but you will lose advantage against those who aren’t free to play.

## The Bad
If there is good then there will be bad, if there is light then there will be shadow.

### Overall Playtime
One of the things that I find the most unsatisfied with the game is the stamina recovery rates. In PGR, your stamina recovers around 10 points each hour but then the costs for the mission are high. For example, each stage costs around 30 per try and the maximum stamina that we can store is 160, I waited a whole night to store lots of stamina but all of them are used in just 30 minutes to 1 hour of game time. You basically need to wait the entire night to just enjoy 30 minutes and 1 hour of game time. Of course there are stages that don't cost any stamina to play but in this stage of the game it does not add much to the playtime. Perhaps it is just a way for them to benefit people who pay so that they can have more playtime and more advantage but for us, there is not much we can do other than to wait.

### Balance of the game
This is really one of the bad things about this game that I find terrible for newcomers or casual players. First, the gameplay. You have limited amounts of dodge and that makes your timing important and you need your timing to be right, different bosses have different timing, the indicator also has different timing when it comes to different bosses. Some boss may indicate their attack .1 seconds before and some others indicate it .5 to 1 seconds before. The inconsistency is bad in this game and it makes the game different to predict. The damage of the boss is also not helping with the timing issues, a boss can easily take your constructs down in just three strikes. This just makes the game soul-like and not casual friendly. 

## My Overall Rating for this game

#### 4.5 out 5

I highly recommend this game to those who seeks for action gacha games and those who wanted to experience new playstyle for action gacha games. Even though there are some downsides but it is worth a try before deciding if you want to stick with the game or not.
