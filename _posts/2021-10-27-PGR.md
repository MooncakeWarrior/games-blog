Punishing Gray Raven is one of my favourite gacha right now and I am here to share my overall experience about this game

<!--more-->

##### At the time of writing this, Punishing Gray Raven is celebrating its 100th day anniversary and as a player since day-1, I want to write about my own experience with the game and how it became one of my favorite gacha games. From this point on Punishing Gray Raven will be simplified to PGR.

## The Good
I like PGR for a lot of reasons, and most of the time these reason are what keeps me interested in this game till this day.

### Skills Orb
PGR features a unique skills system that separates them from all the other competing 3D action gacha games and that is the Skills Orb, there are three types of orb: Red Orb, Yellow Orb and Blue Orb each orb correspond to the different skills to each character. At first glance, it seems confusing but after following the simple tutorial given, I was able to get the hang of it in no time. But don’t let this simple tutorial fool you, the Skills Orb is indeed easy to learn, but it is also hard to master. In order to stay on top of the game, there are a lot of factors and the most important of them all is the timing. Your timing decides everything in this game. You need to decide when to use three-pings, what to ping and most importantly when to ping them. With good timings, you could easily double your score in some stages and easily climb to the top, not to mention the feeling of satisfaction when you chained the skills correctly and just see the enemy’s health bar disappear. Overall, the orb system really adds some spice into the game and makes it so that you actually need to concentrate when playing the game to plan every move correctly in order to push the limits of the character. 

### Overall Game Design
One thing I like about PGR is their immersion, they’ve done it perfectly. PGR do not have any vibrant colors or fancy effects, most of them are actually plain and simple. Now, this doesn't mean that it is bad in any way, it is the opposite, the plain and simple approach actually makes them fit into the world building of the game perfectly. The emotionless constructs, simple and plain colors, the seriousness in every line just makes me immersed in the game. It tells me that the story is not a fairytale where everything has a happy ending but instead it is about the reality, the reality where humans are struggling to survive and everything can go wrong in a flash. 

### Free to play Friendly
Before it’s global release, PGR was actually praised as a free to play friendly game. Of course no gacha is really free to play, they are all designed to earn money in a way. But PGR is a little bit different from the rest of them, they have a specific pattern to help free to play players stay in the game. For example, the update ‘Frozen Darkness’ features a gacha only characters but in the next update ‘Fallen Star’ features free farmable characters for players. This kind of rotation allows free to play players to save up quite a lot of Black Cards which is the type of paid currency used in the game in between the gacha limited characters. They also feature a banner for those limited characters which has a pity of 60 draw to help us get the character more easily. In my experience, the time between which gacha limited character is released is enough for me to get the character without much of a problem. Not only that it is possible for us to collect all limited characters, the characters equipment is also farmable making it so that everyone could have a strong character to play. Of course in order for them to let the game stay afloat, PGR also has costumes and character specific weapons which cater to their playstyle for people who support the game to give them an edge over certain situations. Overall, it is possible to play this game without paying but you will lose advantage against those who aren’t free to play.
