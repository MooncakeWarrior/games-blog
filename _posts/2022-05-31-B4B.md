A short article about my experience with Back 4 Blood

# Back 4 Blood Review


## From the creators of Left 4 Dead. Will Back 4 Blood succeed as Left 4 Dead 3?


# Gameplay

The biggest selling point for Back 4 Blood is going to be that it is from the creator of Left 4 Dead. Could it offer the same or even better experience than the L4D franchise? Unfortunately, the experience of both games differ vastly in my opinion.


## The Difference


### Game Length

The game length is nothing like L4D or L4D2. In both of these games, you can complete an act in an hour or two, that’s right, an act with multiple levels in an hour or two and it is indeed good fun if you want a game that is casual enough. In Back 4 Blood, the level per act has increased drastically. In my experience, I used three hours and still cannot finish one act. I only progressed halfway through the act in my three hour run which is way longer than L4D. The game time can even be increased when the players decide to go into the Ridden Hive, which I will explain later. I feel more comfortable with the game length in L4D than B4B. Why? Because I can play the game on a whim and still be able to enjoy the story and am able to put it down whenever I want. In B4B, after playing through Act 1 and halfway through Act 2 I feel extremely tired. Of course you can join in halfway through the Act but from my experience, everytime I use Quickjoin to hop in Act 2 it always starts from the beginning. 


### Ridden Hive

One of the most notable differences in B4B compared to L4D is the newly added Ridden Hive. The normal map in these games are that you were only given one way to go, one road to progress to the end. But the developer and B4B decided to add another type of challenge to the game by adding a new area called the Ridden Hive. Unlike the one road to the end progression, Ridden Hive is more like a maze for the player to explore around and collect currency used to exchange items. Maybe this addition does spice up the gameplay for some people, but for me, it’s a terrible addition to the game. Now since I do not have any friends to play around with me in B4B yet so I mostly just party up with randoms and whenever they see this, they will all try to go and explore it. My first time there, I spent 30 minutes walking around in the maze not knowing what to do and that is basically my first impression, confusion and boredom. Seeing a maze in this type of one road to the end progression games feels….. weird. Later on when I got more used to the game, another problem about Ridden Hive appeared. And that is the lack of teamwork in a party of randoms. Ridden Hives is hard to clear because of its maze properties thus making it requiring more time than the normal gamemode. The other thing is that the players do not know when to quit the challenge, sometimes all of us are on the verge of dying and it’s clear that we can no longer explore the maze but the whole party still opted to finish it instead. The ending? We died and players started to leave the game. After the players all died, the game restarted at the beginning of the Ridden Hive again thus needing us to go through it once again. It definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.


### Game Difficulty

The difficulty scale of this game is very steep. Compared to L4D and the kind of run and gun feeling that the game gives you, B4B’s difficulty is harder. On the second difficulty, you no longer have the ability to run and gun anymore. Players tend to camp inside a house whenever a large amount of zombies is coming and that kinda makes the game entirely different from L4D in general. Another thing worth noting is that L4D gives players the ability to switch guns halfway thus gaining more ammo for your run and gun action. In B4B, the ammo is constant. Meaning that even when you switch guns halfway through a run, your ammo still carries over from the previous gun. It is much easier to run out of ammo in this game compared to L4D and it makes the experience of the game much more different from L4D.


## So far I am just complaining about the difference between the two games, but is there really nothing that B4B gets right?


## The Good

There are indeed some new mechanics that I like in B4B.


### Gun Modification

One of the things that caught my eye in this game is the ability to mod your gun to your liking. You can have a handgun with a 4x ACOG scope strapped on in and make it a sniper or you can have your sniper and strap a Holo or Reflex on it and make it close range capable. There is endless possibility to mod your gun, you can make a gun that you like and make it so that you feel comfortable with it. I once completed a run with a gun I modded from the start. The different types of modification provided such as scopes, gun barrel, magazine, stock and all of them come with different buffs to suit your playstyle is indeed something I think has kept me playing this game. Trying out new combinations every run and seeing how they fare is really good fun and is indeed something special.

### The graphics

Compared to L4D, you can really see the improvement in overall graphics in B4B. Well they are indeed games that are decades aparts. The fact that the B4B is also quite well optimised. My mid tier computer are able to run it smoothly at 100 FPS and above while maintaining a good enough graphics and providing an enjoyable experience


## The Neutral

These are some of the game mechanics that I am not particularly happy about nor hate.


### The Card Decks

Back 4 Blood introduces a card system that gives you various perks meaning you can have buffs that fits your playstyle to make your gameplay more easier. 


### The Shop

The Shop is one of the things that is quite different compared to L4D. Instead of picking up weapons everywhere, you get to buy weapons directly. Other than weapons, the shop also sells all the things that you will need like ammo, grenades, and health. Yes you can buy health.


#### This is all I feel about the game after 10 hours of gameplay. I will probably make another update once I have more time in this game.
