A short article about my experience with Girl Cafe Gun

<!--more-->
<hr>
Among the numerous 2021 gacha releases Girl Cafe Gun is one of the hyped ones. I joined both CBT1 and CBT2 for the game and there are a few things I want to talk about.

First off let’s start by saying that this game is a wonderful game, it has good character design, acceptable storyline and LOTS of fanservice. But there is something that ultimately makes me unable to engage with the game. 

First, it’s about the way the gacha works, unlike the rotation style which is used by other gacha games such as Punishing Gray Raven and Honkai Impact 3 which lets you save some premium currency before drawing for characters. Girl Cafe Gun takes this quite differently, this game does not have the time for you to save premium currency meaning that you can only try and collect them all instead of being able to collect all of them. That is something that I find hard to accept.

Next, I felt the game was boring battle wise, the gameplay may be fine in the first few days but as more hours are spent in the game, it starts to feel bland and boring. I don’t feel connected to the game, it just feels lacking and really boring.

In a nutshell, this game is just like every other game. There is going to be someone who loves it and plays it daily, there will also be someone who does not find it interesting. For me, it is just not interesting enough for me to follow through.

### TL;DR
It is just not my cup of the tea
